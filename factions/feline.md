{% include stub.md %}

The {% include faction_ping.html faction=page.faction %} are a [faction]({{ "/factions" | relative_url }}) within Amylandia. A great many felines currently reside happily in Amylandia. Felines are typically either scientifically inclined or a bit unintelligent.

Historically, felines have been the natural enemy of the phoxen (see: {% include faction_ping.html faction="space_phox" %}, {% include faction_ping.html faction="snek_phox" %}, {% include faction_ping.html faction="arctic_phox" %}). However, in more recent years, the felines have been taking extra steps to patch up their relationship with the phox so that everyone may live peacefully together.

Felines can always be distracted by any sort of yarn. This is their greatest weakness.

## orphanages

Unfortunately, many kittens are orphans who are looking for loving homes. There are a lot of kitten orphanages around Amylandia that house these poor little kitens. For some unknown reason, kitten orphanages have a tendency of burning down! The felines have been trying to find out why for years, to no avail. If you have room in your home and heart, please consider taking home a kitten.

## feline scientists

Felines, for some reason, tend to have an aptitude for science. Thus, many kittens become feline scientists after growing up. The feline scientists are renowned for some incredible research and projects across all of Amylandia!

### notable projects

#### Objective BN Space Probe

The feline scientists created the project Objective BN Space Probe - a space probe with the purpose of finding sources of bananas in outer space. The {% include faction_ping.html faction="scientist" %} were consultants on this project.

On May 10th 2020, the Objective BN Space Probe was successfully launched! However, complications came up on May 11th, when the probe fell into a wormhole while evading attacks from hostile space bananas. 

On May 28th 2020, connection was briefly re-established. Readings indicated that it had landed in an alternate universe where time flows backwards, and was being (un?)worshipped by hordes of friendly space bananas who had (un?)mistaken the probe for a god. The last visual transmission showed the bananas (un?)building a temple (by tearing it apart) for the probe to reside in.

On June 23rd 2020, connection was once again briefly re-established. Readings indicated that the space probe now resided in an alternate universe version of Amylandia, called Maylandia. Its inhabitants were all giant millipedes with one leg each. The Almighty Benevolent Leader of Maylandia, May, was seen poking the probe repeatedly on the video feed before it mysteriously cut out.

No further contact has been made by the probe.

#### Great Unknown Chess Competition

During the Great Unknown Chess Competition, the science felines create a program to decipher the playing style of the unknown, in order to predict future moves. However, issues came up in the program. Every single variable's pointer got set to a location that shouldn't have existed in memory, and yet somehow also contained the entire genetic code for bananas. What's more, each pointer seemed to point to a different banana that existed in real life. Needless to say, this rendered the program completely useless. What caused this issue is unknown.

### notable felines

#### Viska von Freur

Viska von Freur is the Chief Science Feline of Objective BN, as well as the director of the Objective BN Space Probe project. She is exceedingly intelligent and proficient in all known types of science.

During the Objective BN Space Probe launch, von Freur was arrested for conspiracy to commit grand theft spacebanana. However, after a lengthy investigation, she was released.

#### Dr. Claut Sai

Dr. Claut Sai is the chief science feline of Objective BN. During the von Freur scandal, he lead the Objective BN Space Probe during its launch.
